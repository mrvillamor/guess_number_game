# guess_number_game
CPSC 1181: Assign 1 - Guess Your Number

Objective:
  - to write a complete Java program with a graphical interface with dialog boxes
  - to program in Java procedurally, using static methods
  - to design the Java program so that it's extensible
  - to modularize code (use functions)
  - to come up with a test plan and to use it
  
Description:
  "As a child, my grandmother would tell me to think of a number. Then she would ask me to do some calculations on that number and then she would ask me to tell her the result of those calculations. Afterwards, she would stun me by giving me the number that I had originally chosen in my head! I was young and wondered how she had been able to guess."

Instructions:
Write a Java program that lets the user choose a level of difficulty for the game. Subsequently, your program should:
  - ask the user, with a graphical message box, to think of a number
  - ask the user to perform operations on that number (again the instructions are given graphically)
  - ask the user to give to the program the result of the operations
  - tell the user what his/her mystery number is
  - ask the user whether the user wants to play again, and to repeat the guessing game until the use chooses to stop the process

Requirements:
  - Program procedurally using a top-down design that breaks the problem into smaller problems using functions (methods).
  - Do not make any function too long
  - Your program should be well structured:
    - Do not use <code> break </code> unless you are using a <code> switch </code> statement
    - Do not use <code> while (true) </code> but do use <code> while </code> and <code> for </code> loops as needed
    - Do not use <code> continue </code>
    - Do not use <code> System.exit </code>
  - Use the <code> JOptionPane </code> for input and output
